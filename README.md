# hello-world

Hi All,

Iâ€™m currently coming to the end of a masters in pure mathematics and my current dissertation in on fractals. I really want to get into software development as a career and so came on here to start to learn to code.

I have many ideas I intend to try, including fractals to get started, but as I learn and develop I hope to be able to assist the GitHub community in all there weird and wonderful projects.
